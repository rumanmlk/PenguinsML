# PenguinsML: Comprehensive Analysis of the Penguins Dataset
Welcome to the PenguinsML repository! This project provides an in-depth exploration of the Penguin dataset, covering various aspects of machine learning. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced practitioner, you’ll find valuable insights and code examples here.

## Features:
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
* Understand the dataset’s structure, distributions, and relationships.
* Visualize key features using scatter plots, histograms, and correlation matrices.
### Supervised Learning (Classification):
* Train and evaluate classification models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests) to predict Iris species.
* Asses Accuracy
### Unsupervised Learning (Clustering):
* Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means, DBSCAN) to group similar Iris samples.
* Visualize clusters and assess their quality.
## Getting Started:
* Download the dataset from kaggle : [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashkhagan/palmer-penguins-datasetalternative-iris-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashkhagan/palmer-penguins-datasetalternative-iris-dataset)
* Clone this repository:
`git clone https://github.com/rumanmlk/PenguinsML.git
`
* Install dependencies (e.g., NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn).
* Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory.
* Contribute, experiment, and learn!
